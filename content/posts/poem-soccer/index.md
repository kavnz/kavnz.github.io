![](soccer.jpg)


Stop the ball before it goes out \
While the ref is sniffing his snout \
The crowd goes out it was an excellent save \
The crowd was so pleased they did a Mexican wave

Ping! Someone scored \
The crowd will never get bored \
The match just started \
The players parted

Oh, what a goal \
It went through the poles \
It was great \
But a player was late

Roads are getting wrecked \
The cars are advanced tech \
I pass the line \
I like this rhyme

The games go on \
It's been quite long \
The games are done \
I go for a run
