The moon shone in the night sky as two brothers were fast asleep. The two brothers were best friends. They were unlike most brothers; they didn’t fight a lot. But they had one thing in common: they both wanted to be detectives when they grew up. They would watch and read all about how to be observant, just like Sherlock Holmes. They really did idolise him. They would even pretend to be Sherlock Holmes at school. Most people found them to be misfits and weirdos, so the two kids didn’t have anyone to play with but themselves. The boys were twins and were eleven years old. They went to a school called Scots College just next to the airport. They were exceptionally smart and had skipped primary school and middle school because they were so smart. The boys’ names were Jack and Dillan, and the date was April 1, 2025.
